## ⚠️Warning⚠️

This is one of my old code, and some parts most likely outdated. I have no interest or time to actually go over the code. If someone wants to use this, feel free to fix it.

# Donation-System (for Garry's Mod)

This is a donation/payment system used mainly for Garry's Mod game. This software was one of the firsts scripts on coderhire, the Garry's Mod software market. I have decided to release it in the hopes that someone else might be interested in fixing it(though I haven't tested it, so it might still be working). 

When I first developed this system, I tried to include as much functionality as I could, to cover as many cases as possible. Of course, with that came in the complexity. Due to the complexity I stopped selling this system, as I didn't have time to support every customer that bought this system.
This donation system is only for Garry&#039;s Mod, but its fully customizable and for additional cost I will write plugins for other games.

* Security in mind. (This is not SQL injectable)
